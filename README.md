# Excavator-parts-catalogue-using-AI
OVERVIEW
This repository contains the source code and resources for an Excavator Parts Catalogue generated using artificial intelligence (AI) and the YOLOv8 model. The project spanned over three months and involved the training of the YOLOv8 model with a dataset comprising 450 annotated images.

FEATURES
AI Object Detection: The YOLOv8 model has been trained to recognize and locate various parts of an excavator in images.
Parts Catalogue Generation: The trained model is used to automatically generate a comprehensive parts catalogue for excavators.
Efficient Annotation: The dataset used for training includes 450 annotated images, ensuring accurate and efficient model learning.
Project Structure
data/: Contains the annotated dataset used for training the YOLOv8 model.
model/: Holds the trained YOLOv8 model and associated configuration files.
catalogue/: Includes the generated excavator parts catalogue in various formats.
Usage
Training the Model: If you wish to retrain the model or further improve its performance, refer to the train.py script in the model/ directory.

Generate Catalogue: Run the generate_catalogue.py script in the catalogue/ directory to create the excavator parts catalogue.

Explore Results: Explore the results, including the trained model, annotated dataset, and the generated catalogue in their respective directories.

CONTRIBUTING
Feel free to contribute by improving the model accuracy, expanding the dataset, or enhancing the catalogue generation process. Please check the contributing guidelines for more details.
